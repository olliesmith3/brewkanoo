- Single-Page-App Created in React


# Team goals

- For this project, we had a morning stand up and afternoon check in where we informed each of the groups which issues they would be working on. 
- We had a retro at the end of each two days where we reflected on how the team worked and how this could be more efficient.
- All work was completed via pair programming in order to achieve more reliable progress. 

# Sprint 1

- General discussion of what we wanted from the project - to learn React.
- The first thing we did was set two days aside for learning React basics via online resources. 
- The majority of us built a small notes app as a practice project.
- This was done alone so that everyone could learn atheir own pace.

# Sprint 2

- We decided on some user stories
- Definition of the project and first 2 sprints, creating MVP and the environment to work on
- Self-learning time to understand the new concepts and languages used in the project
- Creating basic User Stories to implement functionality
