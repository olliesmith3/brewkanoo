# Inspiration

- I had found from homebrewing in my own time that current recipe's are difficult to follow, with walls of text and information poorly displayed. The information and tools needed to make a beer often required me to visit many websites and use other apps on my phone. I would have to use timers and calculators, as well as visiting an array of websites for: looking up formulae, coverting units, recipe ideas, tips on a specific step execution, opinions from other homebrewers and understanding the underlying science. Part of the reason for becoming a developer was to streamline the tech that I relied on for my hobbies, so for this project we tried to get all of these things into one place.

# Team goals

- For this project, we had a morning stand up and afternoon check in where we informed each group which issue they would be working on. 
- We had a retro at the end of each two days where we reflected on how the team worked and how this could be more efficient.
- All work was completed via pair programming in order to achieve more reliable progress. 

# Sprint 1

- General discussion of what we wanted from the project - to learn React.
- The first thing we did was set two days aside for learning React basics via online resources. 
- The majority of us built a small notes app as a practice project.
- This was done alone so that everyone could learn at their own pace.

# Sprint 2

- We decided on some user stories for our MVP and created tickets for them.
- Firstly we created the app with create-react-app.
- We then made it possible to select a recipe and follow a text only walkthrough.

# Last 2 sprints

- Focus on styling. As the app was fairly simple in functionality we wanted to make it look cool and have all the information displayed clearly.
- New features: timers, ABV calculator, step checking buttons, additional details on mouse hover.
- Maintained test coverage.

## How to use

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

From here the site is fairly intuitive, choose a recipe and follow the walkthrough. 

## How to run the tests

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
