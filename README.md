- Single-Page-App Created in React

## Motivation 

  In this project we wanted to build a simple walkthrough for the homebrewing process that had helpful calculators and timers that meant anybody could give homebrewing a go whilst only visiting one site. It was also a goal for the four of us to learn React and this was an excellent choice of project to do it on.


# MVP and definition of first 2 sprints

- Definition of the project and first 2 sprints, creating MVP and the environment to work on
- Self-learning time to understand the new concepts and languages used in the project
- Creating basic User Stories to implement functionality
- Pair programming is the method of choice to build this project
